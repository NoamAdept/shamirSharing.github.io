# Shamir Secret Sharing Web App 🔐✨

Welcome to the **Shamir Secret Sharing Web App** – a fun, interactive Flask-based tool that demonstrates the magic of Shamir Secret Sharing! This app lets you convert a message into a secret number, split it into multiple shares using a random polynomial, and reconstruct the secret when enough shares come together. Let’s dive in! 🚀


## Features 🎉

- **Message Encoding/Decoding:**  
  Convert your text messages to a secret number and back – making cryptography accessible and fun! ✉️🔄

- **Interactive UI:**  
  Use intuitive sliders to set your secret, total shares \( n \), and threshold \( t \). Adjust parameters on the fly and see the magic happen! 🎛️🖱️

- **Share Generation & Download:**  
  Easily generate shares and download each one as a text file. Perfect for secure storage and sharing! 💾📤

- **Share Upload:**  
  Reconstruct your secret effortlessly by uploading the share files. Collaboration and security go hand in hand! 🤝🔓

- **Visualization:**  
  Enjoy dynamic plots of your share points (and optionally the polynomial curve) using Plotly. Visualize your secret’s journey from creation to reconstruction! 📈🎨
